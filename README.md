#### PERFORMING DATA ANALYSIS ON THE STACK OVERFLOW SURVEY OF 2017 AND 2018

**The main motto of this project is to follow the process of the CRISP-DM(Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) which are as follows:**


1) Business Understanding  
2) Data Understanding  
3) Data Preparation  
4) Data Modeling  
5) Result evaluation  
6) Deployment

In this notebook, I'll look at the Stack Overflow findings from both 2017 and 2018 to discover more about professional developers and where they should put their attention in order to get the best career prospects.

**In order to obtain this knowledge, I will attempt to answer few questions:**  
1) In the 2017 and 2018, which programming languages are most commonly used and how do they vary in each year?  
2) How does the salary vary based on country, experience and company type in 2018?  
3) Is stack overflow a useful platform for programmers based on the survey?
