Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:
1) In the 2017 and 2018, which programming languages are most commonly used and how do they vary in each year?  
2) How does the salary vary based on country, experience and company type in 2018?  
3) Is stack overflow a useful platform for programmers based on the survey?  

Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@shefaliluley/write-a-data-science-blog-a48374740f98) :
